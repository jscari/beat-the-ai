# Beat the perceptron #
A little game where the player has to guess handwritten digits faster than its computer.

The displayed handwritten digit images are from the [The MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

The AI use a basic Machine Learning algorithm called [Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) (a single-layer Neural Network) and has been trained over 60k examples. Its first guess is correct 88% of the time.
